# Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden and Limited List tracker

This little program will allow you to view the ygo banlist right in your terminal.

## Features

-   Listing: List the contents of the list in two formats, table and json
-   Filtering: Get the entire list or filter through it based on the following criteria:
    -   Diff, get only what changed on the newest list,
    -   Forbidden, get only the newly forbidden cards,
    -   Limited, get only the newly limited cards,
    -   Semi-Limited, get only the newly semi-limited cards,
    -   Unlimited, get only the cards that are now off the list
-   Caching: The program will cache the results so it doesn't have to process them every time it is ran

## Usage

You can see a comprehensive list of all the options by running the help command.

```shell
ygo-fll -h
```

## Examples

As an example you can opt to see the changes from the previous list by running the diff command.

```shell
ygo-fll -d
```

Long options are also supported.

```shell
ygo-fll --diff
```

Example output:

You can chain the output format option to any command to select a different output format.
The default is table, but json is also available.

```shell
ygo-fll -o json
```

Once again, long options are also supported.

```shell
ygo-fll --diff --output-format=json
```

Example output:
